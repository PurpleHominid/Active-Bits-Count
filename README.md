# Active-Bits-Count
An example C++ function that takes an integer and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the number's binary representation; the input is assumed/verified as non-negative.  Example: The binary representation of 392902058 is 10111011010110011010110101010 so the function should return 17, 3811 is 111011100011 so the function should return 8; an excellent online tool to check/test can be found as https://www.exploringbinary.com/binary-converter/
